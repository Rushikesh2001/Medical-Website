        Neurology (from Greek: νεῦρον (neûron), "string, nerve" and the suffix
        -logia, "study of") is a branch of medicine dealing with disorders of
        the nervous system. Neurology deals with the diagnosis and treatment of
        all categories of conditions and disease involving the central and
        peripheral nervous systems (and their subdivisions, the autonomic and
        somatic nervous systems), including their coverings, blood vessels, and
        all effector tissue, such as muscle. Neurological practice relies
        heavily on the field of neuroscience, the scientific study of the
        nervous system.
        <br />
        <br />
        A neurologist is a physician specializing in neurology and trained to
        investigate, or diagnose and treat neurological disorders. Neurologists
        treat a myriad of neurologic conditions, including stroke, seizures,
        movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease, autoimmune neurologic
        disorders such as multiple sclerosis, headache disorders like migraine
        and dementias such as Alzheimer's disease. Neurologists may also be
        involved in clinical research, clinical trials, and basic or
        translational research. While neurology is a nonsurgical specialty, its
        corresponding surgical specialty is neurosurgery.
        <br />
        <br />
        Many neurologists also have additional training or interest in one area
        of neurology, such as stroke, epilepsy, headache, neuromuscular
        disorders, sleep medicine, pain management, or movement disorders.
        <br />
        <br />
        In the United States and Canada, neurologists are physicians who have
        completed a postgraduate training period known as residency specializing
        in neurology after graduation from medical school. This additional
        training period typically lasts four years, with the first year devoted
        to training in internal medicine. On average, neurologists complete a
        total of eight to ten years of training. This includes four years of
        medical school, four years of residency and an optional one to two years
        of fellowship.
        <br />
        <br />
        While neurologists may treat general neurologic conditions, some
        neurologists go on to receive additional training focusing on a
        particular subspecialty in the field of neurology. These training
        programs are called fellowships, and are one to two years in duration.
        Subspecialties include brain injury medicine, clinical neurophysiology,
        epilepsy, neurodevelopmental disabilities, neuromuscular medicine, pain
        medicine, sleep medicine, neurocritical care, vascular neurology
        (stroke), behavioral neurology, child neurology, headache, multiple
        sclerosis, neuroimaging, neurooncology, and neurorehabilitation.
        <br />
        <br />
        In Germany, a compulsory year of psychiatry must be done to complete a
        residency of neurology.
        <br />
        <br />
        In the United Kingdom and Ireland, neurology is a subspecialty of
        general (internal) medicine. After five years of medical school and two
        years as a Foundation Trainee, an aspiring neurologist must pass the
        examination for Membership of the Royal College of Physicians (or the
        Irish equivalent) and complete two years of core medical training before
        entering specialist training in neurology.Up to the 1960s, some
        intending to become neurologists would also spend two years working in
        psychiatric units before obtaining a diploma in psychological medicine.
        However, that was uncommon and, now that the MRCPsych takes three years
        to obtain, would no longer be practical. A period of research is
        essential, and obtaining a higher degree aids career progression. Many
        found it was eased after an attachment to the Institute of Neurology at
        Queen Square, London. Some neurologists enter the field of
        rehabilitation medicine (known as physiatry in the US) to specialise in
        neurological rehabilitation, which may include stroke medicine, as well
        as traumatic brain injuries

        Cardiology (from Greek καρδίᾱ kardiā, "heart" and -λογία -logia,
        "study") is a branch of medicine that deals with disorders of the heart
        and the cardiovascular system. The field includes medical diagnosis and
        treatment of congenital heart defects, coronary artery disease, heart
        failure, valvular heart disease and electrophysiology. Physicians who
        specialize in this field of medicine are called cardiologists, a
        specialty of internal medicine. Pediatric cardiologists are
        pediatricians who specialize in cardiology. Physicians who specialize in
        cardiac surgery are called cardiothoracic surgeons or cardiac surgeons,
        a specialty of general surgery.
        <br />
        <br />
        Cardiology is a specialty of internal medicine. To be a cardiologist in
        the United States, a three-year residency in internal medicine is
        followed by a three-year fellowship in cardiology. It is possible to
        specialize further in a sub-specialty. Recognized sub-specialties in the
        United States by the ACGME are cardiac electrophysiology,
        echocardiography, interventional cardiology, and nuclear cardiology.
        Recognized subspecialties in the United States by the American
        Osteopathic Association Bureau of Osteopathic Specialists (AOABOS)
        include clinical cardiac electrophysiology and interventional
        cardiology. While in India, a person needs to undergo three years of
        residency in General Medicine or Pediatrics after M.B.B.S and then three
        years of residency in Cardiology to be a D.M/Diplomate of National Board
        (DNB) in Cardiology.
        <br />
        <br />
        Cardiac electrophysiology is the science of elucidating, diagnosing, and
        treating the electrical activities of the heart. The term is usually
        used to describe studies of such phenomena by invasive (intracardiac)
        catheter recording of spontaneous activity as well as of cardiac
        responses to programmed electrical stimulation (PES). These studies are
        performed to assess complex arrhythmias, elucidate symptoms, evaluate
        abnormal electrocardiograms, assess risk of developing arrhythmias in
        the future, and design treatment. These procedures increasingly include
        therapeutic methods (typically radiofrequency ablation, or cryoablation)
        in addition to diagnostic and prognostic procedures. Other therapeutic
        modalities employed in this field include antiarrhythmic drug therapy
        and implantation of pacemakers and automatic implantable
        cardioverter-defibrillators (AICD).
        <br />
        <br />
        The cardiac electrophysiology study (EPS) typically measures the
        response of the injured or cardiomyopathic myocardium to PES on specific
        pharmacological regimens in order to assess the likelihood that the
        regimen will successfully prevent potentially fatal sustained
        ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) in the
        future. Sometimes a series of EPS drug trials must be conducted to
        enable the cardiologist to select the one regimen for long-term
        treatment that best prevents or slows the development of VT or VF
        following PES. Such studies may also be conducted in the presence of a
        newly implanted or newly replaced cardiac pacemaker or AICD.
        <br />
        <br />
        Clinical cardiac electrophysiology is a branch of the medical specialty
        of cardiology and is concerned with the study and treatment of rhythm
        disorders of the heart. Cardiologists with expertise in this area are
        usually referred to as electrophysiologists. Electrophysiologists are
        trained in the mechanism, function, and performance of the electrical
        activities of the heart. Electrophysiologists work closely with other
        cardiologists and cardiac surgeons to assist or guide therapy for heart
        rhythm disturbances (arrhythmias). They are trained to perform
        interventional and surgical procedures to treat cardiac arrhythmia.

        Psychiatry refers to a field of medicine focused specifically on the
        mind, aiming to study, prevent, and treat mental disorders in humans. It
        has been described as an intermediary between the world from a social
        context and the world from the perspective of those who are mentally
        ill.
        <br />
        <br />
        Psychiatry is the medical specialty devoted to the diagnosis,
        prevention, and treatment of mental disorders. These include various
        maladaptations related to mood, behaviour, cognition, and perceptions.
        <br />
        <br />
        Initial psychiatric assessment of a person typically begins with a case
        history and mental status examination. Physical examinations and
        psychological tests may be conducted. On occasion, neuroimaging or other
        neurophysiological techniques are used. Mental disorders are often
        diagnosed in accordance with clinical concepts listed in diagnostic
        manuals such as the International Classification of Diseases (ICD),
        edited and used by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the widely
        used Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM),
        published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA). The fifth
        edition of the DSM (DSM-5) was published in May 2013 which re-organized
        the larger categories of various diseases and expanded upon the previous
        edition to include information/insights that are consistent with current
        research.
        <br />
        <br />
        Combined treatment with psychiatric medication and psychotherapy has
        become the most common mode of psychiatric treatment in current
        practice, but contemporary practice also includes a wide variety of
        other modalities, e.g., assertive community treatment, community
        reinforcement, and supported employment. Treatment may be delivered on
        an inpatient or outpatient basis, depending on the severity of
        functional impairment or on other aspects of the disorder in question.
        An inpatient may be treated in a psychiatric hospital. Research within
        psychiatry as a whole is conducted on an interdisciplinary basis with
        other professionals, such as epidemiologists, nurses, social workers,
        occupational therapists, or clinical psychologists.
        <br />
        <br />
        People who specialize in psychiatry often differ from most other mental
        health professionals and physicians in that they must be familiar with
        both the social and biological sciences. The discipline studies the
        operations of different organs and body systems as classified by the
        patient's subjective experiences and the objective physiology of the
        patient. Psychiatry treats mental disorders, which are conventionally
        divided into three general categories: mental illnesses, severe learning
        disabilities, and personality disorders. Although the focus of
        psychiatry has changed little over time, the diagnostic and treatment
        processes have evolved dramatically and continue to do so. Since the
        late 20th century, the field of psychiatry has continued to become more
        biological and less conceptually isolated from other medical fields.
